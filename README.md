This is the step-by-step process :

### **1. MAKING the project according to the assignement✅**



* started by making index.html with header elements first
* added css.style ; first defined universal rules and root colors + body
* defined the 5 sections layout by their background-color and size
* working on each sections at the time, starting with "header" going down vertically
* once everything was in place as it should be : I added images, logo and text according to my theme (for the company name and texts I used ChatGpt)
* added more colors and border on images to make it pop-out!
* once satisfied with the results: git push repos/
* im done! (for now)







### **2. IMPROVING the initial project by adding more creative elements according to the theme. (on going)**



* added absolute img to the "call-to-action" section
* added a new section "life" : img ; title + text
*
