# odin-landing-page



* This is the final project of the CSS part from the Foundation's TOP course.
* Here you'll find my project of a landing page for a space-enginerring company who have recently launched their revolutionnary space-program : landing on Mars and colonazing-it (yep).



This is the step-by-step process :



##### **1. MAKING the project according to the assignement : DONE✅**



* **start by making index.html with header elements first ✅**
* **add css.style ; first defined universal rules and root colors + body ✅**
* **define the 5 sections layout by their background-color and size ✅**
* **working on each sections at the time, starting with "header" going down vertically ✅**
* **once everything was in place as it should be : I added images, logo and text according to my theme (for the company name and texts I used ChatGpt) ✅**
* **add more colors and border on images to make it pop-out! ✅**
* **once satisfied with the results: git push repos/ ✅**
* **Im done! (for now)**



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*--> One month later (done 100% Foundations), I'm coming back to this to improve it a little.
--> Mainly focus on creativity to add colors, flexbox, pages \& new sections ; will add some basic JS to use what I've learned so far !*





##### **2. FIXING the page to be displaying correctly : working on ..**



* improve \& clean div structure **✅**
* fix layout (Flexbox), preventing page to get crushed if resize :

 	**- removed height on section, was causing major size problems for the entire page ✅**

 	**- fix flex layout on section 1, .header and .hero, add a new container div ✅**









##### **3. IMPROVING the initial project by adding more creative elements according to the theme : working on ..**



* **add img to the "call-to-action" section ✅**
* **add a new section "life" : img ; title + text ✅**
